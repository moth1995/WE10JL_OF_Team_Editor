to get the right order of nationalities you gotta search in the sles (or in some versions in the over) (with a hex editor)
for "AUSTRIA" (some older ones "Austria")and you will find two results, 
in one result you will notice you have the national teams names and then the club teams, go to the next result
there you will have the right order of nationalities that's the right way to get them ;)
or just use the formula done in the pes editor that also works, but i prefer to use something standard
